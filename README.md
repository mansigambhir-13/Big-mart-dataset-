# Big-mart-dataset-

he Big Mart dataset is a sales prediction challenge that provides historical sales data for products across various stores of Big Mart, a large retail chain. The dataset includes information about products, outlets, and their sales performance. Key features include:

Product details: Weight, fat content, visibility in store, type, etc.
Outlet information: Establishment year, size, location type
Sales data: Item outlet sales (target variable)

The goal is to build a predictive model to forecast sales of products across different outlets.

# Big Mart Sales Prediction

This project utilizes the Big Mart dataset to predict sales for various products across different outlets of a large retail chain.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset includes information about:
- Products (weight, visibility, type, etc.)
- Outlets (establishment year, size, location)
- Sales data

## Project Approach
1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzed product and outlet features to understand their relationship with sales.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to improve model performance.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.
4. **Model Building**: Implemented and compared multiple regression models:
   - Linear Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
5. **Model Evaluation**: Used RMSE and R-squared to assess model performance.
6. **Prediction**: Applied the best-performing model to predict sales on test data.
7. obtained the accuracy of 98% using XG boost regression technique

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XG boost regression model
